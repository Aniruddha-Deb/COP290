Everything works? Some bugs in the server (game crashes sometimes when you 
connect to the server), otherwise we ended up implementing everything we were
supposed to implement.

Some other things (given more time):
- Occlusion: too complicated to implement, as would require rendering a partial
  outline of the sprite occluded 
- More NPC's? 
- Bigger map
- Make networking more robust
